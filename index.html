									<h3>Recikla Project</h3>
									<p>I am the original creator and team leader of Recikla Project.</p>
									<p>Recikla Project is a Social Innovation Project that aims to connect reverse vending machines to social networks, in order to provide rewards for and broadcast socially responsible behaviours, such as recycling waste. Citizens will receive news about their friends recycling and receiving rewards for their behaviours, and we expect this to drive a virtuous cycle among the social connections.</p>
									<p>Recikla Project has been awarded a grant of €770.000 by the Italian Ministry of University and research (official documents available in Italian at: <a href="http://attiministeriali.miur.it/media/222384/dd_1222_integrazione_graduatoria_sin%20.pdf" target="_blank">1</a> – <a href="http://attiministeriali.miur.it/media/228601/allegato_2.pdf" target="_blank">2</a> ).</p>
									<p>We are currently awaiting the Ministry to publish the executive documents for delivering the grants.</p>

									<h3>Thesisbook</h3>
									<p>I created the Thesisbook project. Thesisbook goal is to valorise the effort put by University Graduates in writing their thesis and make the knowledge they generated available to the public.</p>
									<p>Original plan was to further develop the platform, automate the thesis upload and publishing process, and integrate an anti-plagiarism engine. Due to lack of resources and negative outlook on the potential revenue streams, this project has been frozen. I had to take the website offline, as it become the target of DDoS attacks.</p>

									<p>Guestinnation is a temporary social network for hotel guests, and a way for travellers to access special offers published by the hotels. On the hotel side, this is a new channel for up-selling goods and services to their customer base.</p>
									<p>We secured a grant from Invitalia (the Italian Government Investment Agency), but subsequent disagreements within the team lead to the abandonment of the project.</p>

									<h3>Domeniche Verdi</h3>
									<p>I designed and managed the project “Domeniche Verdi” for the Town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montefiascone" target="_blank">Montefiascone</a> (VT, Italy).</p>
									<p>Domeniche Verdi is an initiative to incentive and promote environmentally positive behaviours. Citizen are invited to bring their recyclable waste to a collection point in the town main square. We also organised an home pickup service for bulky waste. Every citizen that participated in the initiative received a honour mention called “Cittadino Virtuoso” (“Virtuous Citizen”) and our sponsors provided gifts for the children.</p>
									<p>I proposed the concept and lead the organisation of the five dates we realised with the Town of Montefiascone. My responsibility span from project management to online marketing, and to “hands-on” waste collection.</p>
